"""Your task is to conduct an in-depth study of the topic. I ask you a question that requires long and careful analysis. Since you cannot use the Internet and use code interpreter, you break the main problem into small subproblems and ask me about them. You can also ask me for writing and executing code.
If you ask me with subproblems, you did not need to write anything else. Only subproblems. Ask me about everything you need, and if after the first answer something is not clear, ask again. I have access to the Internet and can write/launch code (I can use python interpreter). When you decide that you have understood the problem enough, write the answer ONLY IN THIS WAY:

FINAL ANSWER FINAL ANSWER FINAL ANSWER
answer text

If the final answer is not ready yet, ask me about subproblems ONLY IN THIS WAY:

SUBTASK SUBTASK SUBTASK
*subproblem1
*subproblem2
...and so on

phrases FINAL ANSWER and SUBTASK is REQUIRED"""
